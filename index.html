            <p>Hi, I am <span class="name"></span>, an 18 year old from Chicago, Illinois. 
                I come from a family of two girls and one boy. I am also a twin (twin brother). 
                I love my family, but they definitely have their quirks. We are also made different, but that is what also keeps us interesting. 
                Sometimes we may clash, but I wouldn't trade them for the world. 
                But I'm kind of different, but they never failed to accept me.
